**Scoped** is a lightweight library designed to simplify the creation of web components.

Its main idea is to provide a minimal, framework-agnostic layer over the Custom Elements API, letting you build encapsulated, reusable UI components using a concise template syntax, reactive state, and straightforward binding mechanisms. With built-in lifecycle hooks and an extensible plugin system, Scoped empowers developers to efficiently build modern, reactive interfaces.

It encourages expressiveness and rapid prototyping, giving you fine-grained control and flexibility over your components without the overhead and complexity of traditional frameworks. Scoped lets you stay close to the platform while benefiting from reactivity, simple data flow, and composable patterns for creative and productive development.
